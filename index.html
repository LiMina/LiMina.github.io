          <p>
            Although born in California, I grew up in Massachusetts, and graduated from <a href="http://lps.lexingtonma.org/lexingtonhs" target=_blank>Lexington High School</a> in June 2012. I returned to California for my undergraduate education, and graduated from the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/" target=_blank>University of California, Berkeley</a> in May 2015 with a BA in <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/" target=_blank>Computer Science</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now work as a Software Engineer for the Digital Marketing team at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target=_blank>Adobe</a>, as part of the <a href="http://www.tubemogul.com/" target=_blank>TubeMogul</a> acquisition.

              <h2>Professional Life</h2>
              <p>
               In the last few years, I've done work ranging from search engine optimization to front-end development to bioinformatics to game-making to information security. Currently, I work in the video advertising industry at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target=_blank>Adobe</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have spent the most time programming with Java and Python, but am happy to pick up languages as I go. Occasionally I dabble with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to update my website.
              </p>
              <p>
                My current focus at work is to improve system stability and performance.

              <h2>Personal Life</h2>
              <p>
                I live with my boyfriend, <a href="geckos.html">two geckos</a>, and a <a href="cinnamon.html">snake</a>. In my free time, I like to go on hikes, take classes on <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target=_blank>edX</a> and read books! I also like to cook and try new foods.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've participated in NaNoWriMo six years, and have completed a 50K word novel(la) five of those times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although it's considered old-fashioned at this point, I truly enjoy writing hand-written letters to my long-distance friends, taking the time to send it via "snail mail", and I maintain a few such correspondences with good friends.

              <h3>Publications</h3>
              <p>
                Back in high school, I was published in a Massachusetts publication called <a href="https://themarblecollection.org/" target=_blank>The Marble Collection</a>. I volunteered for the magazine for about a year as part of their Student Advisory Board.
