              <p>
                This is an application I made with Albert Hu, Terry Tsai, Jack Chou, Kenneth Lam, and Arlan Jaska for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucbsaas/" target=_blank>CS169</a>.
              <br /><br />
                <strong>Work Done:</strong>
              <br />
                Planned and designed an online interface for professors to define submission requirements and for students to submit final projects for display purposes. Met biweekly with a non-technical client from the UC Berkeley <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/" target=_blank>Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a> to refine user stories and follow Agile development procedures.Implemented models to organize projects, users, submissions, and requirements RESTfully.

              <h4>September 2014 - October 2014</h4>
              <p>
                This is a game I made with Austin Shyu, Calvin Lu, and Tracy Lee for <a href="http://qgcon.com/" target=_blank>QGCon 2014</a>.
              <br /><br />
                <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
              <br />
                Story-writing, GUI design and layout, scheduling, goal-setting, managing the repository, writing up the readme, and presenting at QGCon 2014.
              <br /><br />
                <strong>Game Overview:</strong>
              <br />
                Our game is a slice-of-life visual novel with the player experiencing daily struggles through the lens of a queer student. As you navigate through the challenges in life and school, you'll find yourself in battle with metaphorical monsters and fight with challenge-specific attacks to overcome the obstacle in your day. Plan your attacks wisely to maximize your happiness and well-being, but don't forget about your grades, too!

              <h4>Nov 2012 - Dec 2012</h4>
              <p>
                This was my final project for <a href="http://cs10.org" target=_blank>CS10</a> that I made with Christine Rickansrud and Tobin Holcomb.
              <br /><br />
                <strong>Summary:</strong>
              <br />
                The class was primarily taught in BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks), an extension of MIT's <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target=_blank>Scratch</a>, and we were given the opportunity to program a <a href="http://www.finchrobot.com/" target=_blank>Finch robot</a> using the online version of BYOB, called <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" target=_blank>Snap!</a>. (At this time, BYOB and Snap! are one and the same, but previously, BYOB was a separate piece of software.)
