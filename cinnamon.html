          She is a <a href="http://therainbowboa.co.uk/columbian_rainbow_boa_caresheet.htm" target=_blank>Columbian Rainbow Boa</a> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Epicrates cenchria maurus</span>). She's still growing, and is somewhere between 3-4ft, but when she's an adult, she'll be somewhere between 5-6ft long.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she's in her tank, she's usually found in her half log or shoved under her water dish. (Who knows why that place is so comfortable...?) When she's out and about, she loves trying to sit on people's glasses, which she could do easily as a baby, but she's far too big for that now. Someday, I'll get her a pair of those <a href="http://www.sillyjokes.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_6134.jpg" target=_blank>giant joke glasses</a>. Sometimes, though, she'll find a way to get into the most annoying places, like inside of a desk chair. (See image above.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We feed her rats that are about the same size as the widest part of her body. (Not live ones, though, since they're more likely to fight back and cause injuries.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're wondering, no, we keep her in her own tank and not with the <a href="geckos.html">geckos</a>.
